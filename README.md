# tic-tac-toe

This is a collaborative project about building a simple tic-tac-toe game. it is basically
applying object oriented programming concepts in ruby using classes, instances and methods to create the interface and game logic

The game comprises a minimum and maximum of two players. Each player chooses a separate character X or O. The board has 9 spaces with 3 rows and 3 columns. when a player uses his/her character to fill up three spaces, either diagonal, horizontal or vetical before the other, a winner emerges and the game restarts if there's no winner(a tie), the game ends and restarts

The rules include:

1.  The game must be played in turns i.e only one player at a time
2.  One player to a character
3.  once a move is made on a space, it can't be unmade. i.e space positions can't be changed
